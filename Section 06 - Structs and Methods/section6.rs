fn main() {
    // 1. Define a struct named `Point` with two fields, `x` and `y`, both of type f64.
    // Your code here

    // 2. Create an instance of `Point` with the values x = 3.0 and y = 4.0.
    // Your code here

    // 3. Implement a method for `Point` called `distance_from_origin` that takes an immutable reference to `self`
    // and returns the distance of the point from the origin (0, 0) as an f64.
    // Your code here

    // 4. Call the `distance_from_origin` method on the `Point` instance created in step 2 and print the result.
    // Your code here
}
